Unit 1 site design learning diary
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. Caution::
   This is currently being worked. Unit 1 data below is not reflective to a complete state. Check back soon.


Summary
========

    *"I took my time to complete this unit because I knew that if I made purposeful decisions, then it would make for an easier time completing the coding in the later units. I disregarded style sheets and visual design, leaving my mock up to be a very bare metal with an emphasis on the sitemap, carefully engineered to my personas and their scenarios."*


The work
==========
.. describe briefly what you have done as work for that unit.


1. Visit `AU course book <https://scis.lms.athabascau.ca/mod/book/view.php?id=13059>`_ > **print book** as .pdf for offline reading.

2. Read the 19 instruction pages.

    .. Note::
       The Unit 1 orientation reading markup is provided as an attachment under **References**.

3. Prepare the design documentation.

   - What kind of website, the theme and purpose
   - Personas
   - Scenarios
   - Further requirements
   - Mockup
   - Site map
   - Learning diary

4. Upload the documentation to GitHub and submit a learning diary post as a blog entry in the **Group Blog**.

5. Notify the tutor of the submission, and `upload to the AU drop box<https://scis.lms.athabascau.ca/mod/assign/view.php?id=22720>`.



The rationale
==============
.. describe the rationale for what you have done, relating your work explicitly to the personas and scenarios you developed in Unit 1.

Theme and purpose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I chose a site that I am passionate about; building CRUD tools for an industry I am already working in. I think this is useful because it helps others who don't have the time to dig into the hours of debugging required to write some of these tools, or those who may not have the programming background to do it themselves. 

Personas and scenarios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I made sure to prepare a future-proof way of managing my personas, which are important because they dictate a lot of the compliant code I will need to write to make the site responsive and compliant with AODA requirements for accessibility.

I used a .csv for the data, and an .indd file for the publishing template. Since I know that this can change in future, I want to make sure I have an easy way to edit the source data and re-publish the .pdf's quickly. The way I have designed this has automated this process for me, since the template accepts the persona data as variables, managed from the .csv.

Further requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I considered a few legal obligations, and fortunately, my site does not have many. Since it's more a personal blog with tools that help others for an industry I am involved in, then I can choose style guides and schemas as they suit me. One thing I need to be aware of is compliance declarations, privacy notices, and warnings to remove liability for potential data and system corruption when running any of the tools.

Mock up and site map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The map
========
.. for each learning outcome for the unit, explain how you have met it, with reference to the content that you produce (typically your code or other design artifacts).

Use this section to map my learning with the expected outcomes. This section is for the assessors who are grading my work.

Expected outcomes for Unit 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Identify the potential audience and purpose for a website.
2. Use a simple but structured process to identify how the website will address the needs of the anticipated audience.
