   Nothing to see here. I am currently working Unit 3. Check back soon, since I'm updating these docs as I work on the code.

Summary
========

   *"Lorem ipsum - pending completion of this unit"*


The work
==========
.. describe briefly what you have done as work for that unit.

1. Visit `AU course book <https://scis.lms.athabascau.ca/mod/book/view.php?id=13063>`_ > **print book** as .pdf for offline reading.

2. Read the 15 instruction pages.

    .. Note::
       The Unit 3 reading markup is provided as an attachment under **References**.

3. Make code I created in Unit 2 **"...beautiful and useable without changing HTML**.

    - Can change ``div``, ``span``, and add extra ``id`` or ``class`` tags.
    - ideally **do not change HTML unless necessary**.
    - change ``head`` tags as needed.

5. Upload the docs to GitHub and submit a learning diary post as a blog entry in the **Group Blog**

6. Notify the tutor of the submission, and upload to the **AU drop box**.
