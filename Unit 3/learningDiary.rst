Unit 3 CSS site styling learning diary
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. _unit3-ref:

.. Warning::
   Nothing to see here. I am currently working Unit 3. Check back soon, since I'm updating these docs as I work on the code.

Summary
========

   *"Since I already know CSS, I decided to learn SASS and SCSS. This unit was difficult to execute because it requires knowing about the technologies in the units ahead, before actually studying them. I found myself studying into unit 4 and 5 concurrently to overcome this. For example, I found myself thinking the only way to animate something was with CSS, but in later units, we would be learning how to do this with javascript. This incurred a bit of technical debt which I hope is paid off."*


The work
==========
.. describe briefly what you have done as work for that unit.

1. Visit `AU course book <https://scis.lms.athabascau.ca/mod/book/view.php?id=13063>`_ > **print book** as .pdf for offline reading.

2. Read the 15 instruction pages.

    .. Note::
       The Unit 3 reading markup is provided as an attachment under **References**.

3. Make code I created in Unit 2 **"...beautiful and useable without changing HTML**.

    - Can change ``div``, ``span``, and add extra ``id`` or ``class`` tags.
    - ideally **do not change HTML unless necessary**.
    - change ``head`` tags as needed.

4. Upload the docs to GitHub and submit a learning diary post as a blog entry in the **Group Blog**

5. Notify the tutor of the submission, and upload to the **AU drop box**.

The learning map

Use this section to map my learning with the expected outcomes. This section is for the assessors who are grading my work.

Expected outcomes for Unit 3
-----------------------------
1. Write well-structured, easily maintained, standard compliant CSS to present HTML pages in different ways.


What went right and wrong
==========================
.. describe what you would do differently if you had to do it again.
