Unit 0 orientation learning diary
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Summary
========

    *"I was able to complete the activities, and started a course of action which is aligned to the suggested tempo of study in the outline. I reviewed the portfolio requirements, and have a good idea of what I'd like to make. My learning diary is created, and I created a template to make sure it's easy to author while I code. Since it was optional, I did not connect with other students, though I'm sure in time, I will. My SCIS request has been submitted, and I am waiting for access to set up a web space."*


The work
==========
.. describe briefly what you have done as work for that unit.
.. note::
   This section briefly describes what I completed for the unit.


1. Visit `AU course book <https://scis.lms.athabascau.ca/mod/book/view.php?id=13057>`_ > **print book** as .pdf for offline reading.

2. Read the 41 orientation pages.

    .. Note::
       The Unit 0 orientation reading markup is provided as an attachment under **References**.

3. Submit a support ticket for SCIS access to the web server.

4. Create a template for learning diary formats in reStructuredText.

5. Join the COMP266 group and read class mate blog posts.

6. Read the COMP266 FAQ.

7. Submit a learning diary post as a blog entry in the **Group Blog**.


The rationale
==============
.. describe the rationale for what you have done, relating your work explicitly to the personas and scenarios
   you developed in Unit 1.

The work performed is aligned with the course outline, including requesting access to the SCIS server, joining the COMP266 group, and submitting this blog entry. 

I decided to download the reading for offline viewing since I could add annotations and submit it as evidence that the reading is complete. I've created a template in reStructuredText because I'll be working in an IDE and it'll be easy to document as I code, which I can then paste over to the AU landing page, and submit as part of the evidence in future.


The map
========
.. for each learning outcome for the unit, explain how you have met it, with reference to the content that you produce (typically your code or other design artifacts).

.. Tip:: 
   Normally, an evaluator will find the mapped activities to learning outcomes here. Right now, Unit 0 has no direct correlation to the template provided by AU. You can read this paragraph below to understand how the work completed correlates to the learning outcomes of Unit 0, but in future, you can expect to see the template for mapped activities here. 

Expected outcomes for Unit 0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Complete the unit 0 activities - start to plan your course of action.
2. Review the portfolio requirements
3. Set up a learning diary blog in the landing, and write your first reflection.
4. Optional - start making connections with COMP266 students.
5. Set up your website in the SCIS web space provided.


My mapped learning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I was able to complete the activities, and started a course of action which is aligned to the suggested tempo of study in the outline. I reviewed the portfolio requirements, and have a good idea of what I'd like to make. My learning diary is created, and I created a template to make sure it's easy to author while I code. Since it was optional, I did not connect with other students, though I'm sure in time, I will. My SCIS request has been submitted, and I am waiting for access to set up a web space.

All in all, my work is aligned with the desired outcome of unit 0; I am informed of what is needed to successfully pass and complete COMP 266.



What went right and wrong
==========================
.. describe what you would do differently if you had to do it again.

If I could re-do this unit, I would use **Adobe Acrobat** to organize pages and *remove* the unecessary duplicate pages. Rather than be 41 pages, the introduction course reading is really ~30 pages(+-), and the other 10 are duplicate to themselves. I may have also been better to submit an access support ticket during the week or earlier in the course, so that IT could grant me permissions to the server sooner. 


Related topics
================
.. link related reading or topics

.. Note::
   There is nothing to see here. In the future. you can expect to see related blog posts from earlier units listed here.
