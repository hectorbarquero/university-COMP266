Orientation learning diary
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Summary
========

    *"I was able to complete the activities, and started a course of action which is aligned to the suggested tempo of study in the outline. I reviewed the portfolio requirements, and have a good idea of what I'd like to make. My learning diary is created, and I created a template to make sure it's easy to author while I code. Since it was optional, I did not connect with other students, though I'm sure in time, I will. My SCIS request has been submitted, and I am waiting for access to set up a web space."*


The work
==========
.. describe briefly what you have done as work for that unit.
.. note::
   This section briefly describes what I completed for the unit.


1. Visit `AU course book <https://scis.lms.athabascau.ca/mod/book/view.php?id=13057>`_ > **print book** as .pdf for offline reading.

2. Read the 41 orientation pages.

    .. Note::
       The Unit 0 orientation reading markup is provided as an attachment under **References**.

3. Submit a support ticket for SCIS access to the web server.

4. Create a template for learning diary formats in reStructuredText.

5. Join the COMP266 group and read class mate blog posts.

6. Read the COMP266 FAQ.

7. Submit a learning diary post as a blog entry in the **Group Blog**.


Assignment 0 submission
=========================
.. describe the rationale for what you have done, relating your work explicitly to the personas and scenarios
   you developed in Unit 1.

I requested access to the SCIS server, joined the COMP266 group, and submitted this blog entry. 

I decided to download the reading for offline viewing since I could add annotations and submit it as evidence that the reading is complete. 

I've created a template in reStructuredText because I'll be working in an IDE/nvim/terminal and it'll be easy to document as I code, which I can then paste over to the AU landing page, and submit as part of the evidence in future.


The learning map
=================
.. for each learning outcome for the unit, explain how you have met it, with reference to the content that you produce (typically your code or other design artifacts).

There is no learning map for Unit 0. The objective of Unit 0 was to get an introduction into the course structure, and set up a learning diary, which you're reading now.


What went right and wrong
==========================
.. describe what you would do differently if you had to do it again.

If I could re-do this unit, I would use **Adobe Acrobat** to organize pages and *remove* the unecessary duplicate pages. Rather than be 41 pages, the introduction course reading is really ~30 pages(+-), and the other 10 are duplicate to themselves. I may have also been better to submit an access support ticket during the week or earlier in the course, so that IT could grant me permissions to the server sooner.
