Find the rubric here and grade my work here:


Expected outcomes for Unit 5
-----------------------------
+ write well-structured, easily maintained JavaScript code following accepted good practice, including
     - general appearance and form: well-commented, properly laid out, appropriate capitalization.
     - structure: modular, using functions, classes and objects effectively, making effective use of variables.
     - standards-compliant: avoiding proprietary elements where possible and working with the vast majority of web browsers.
     - accessible: usable in some form by people with a wide range of disabilities or, if not, failing gracefully and offering alternatives to achieve similar functionality.

+ make effective and efficient use of a full range of programming constructs including sequence, selection and iteration.
+ effectively use variables, including passed parameters, local and global variables and arrays, to improve the efficiency, re-use, and maintainability of the code.
+ use a wide range of programming features and commands to improve the efficiency, re-use and maintainability of the code.
+ write JavaScript code that works in all major browsers (including IE, Mozilla-based browsers such as Firefox, Opera, Konqueror, Safari, Chrome).
+ effectively debug JavaScript code, making use of good practice and debugging tools.
