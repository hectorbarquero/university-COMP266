Summary
========

   *"Despite working with HTML 4.01 in the past, I chose to use HTML5 to benefit from deeper learning. I'm optimistic about the standard, with things like default canvas graphics API, the native support for features like .svg, <audio> and <video> tags, the strong focus on the DOM, mobile optimization, and form controls."*


The work
==========
.. describe briefly what you have done as work for that unit.

1. Visit `AU course book <https://scis.lms.athabascau.ca/mod/book/view.php?id=13061>`_ > **print book** as .pdf for offline reading.

2. Read the 18 instruction pages.

    .. Note::
       The Unit 2 reading markup is provided as an attachment under **References**.

3. Prepare the site HTML.

   - Create 15 HTML pages, compliant with HTML5
   - Several images, custom made
   - Hyperlinks between all the pages using relative URLs
   - Sufficient text for three heading styles
   - Several unordered lists
   - Several div, span, and id tags for styling, to be applied later
   - A table
   - A form, which mails the contents to me

4. Upload the docs to GitHub and submit a learning diary post as a blog entry in the **Group Blog**

5. Notify the tutor of the submission, and upload to the **AU drop box**.



Assignment 2 submission
========================
.. describe the rationale for what you have done, relating your work explicitly to the personas and scenarios you developed in Unit 1.

The learning map
=================
.. for each learning outcome for the unit, explain how you have met it, with reference to the content that you produce (typically your code or other design artifacts).

Use this section to map my learning with the expected outcomes. This section is for the assessors who are grading my work.

Expected outcomes for Unit 2
-----------------------------
1. Write well-structured, easily maintained, standards-compliant, accessible HTML code.

My mapped learning

   AU evaluators use this rubric to grade assignments. To comment, open the build menu, titled **v: latest** > select .pdf to > comment on a local pdf reader.

What went right and wrong
==========================
.. describe what you would do differently if you had to do it again.

Despite working with HTML 4.01 in the past, I chose to use HTML5 to benefit from deeper learning. I'm optimistic about the default canvas graphics API in HTML5, the native support for features like .svg, <audio> and <video> tags, the strong focus on the DOM, mobile optimization, and form controls. 

If I were to do this unit again, I would focus on completing *just* enough to submit and move on to Unit 3, rather than completing all of my site .html pages. 

The reason I think this would have been better is that it would have allowed me to get to the later units more quickly, and discover what might need to change sooner. 

Normally, I program both side-by-side, and doing all of the .html first might become problematic later and require more technical debt.
