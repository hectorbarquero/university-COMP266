COMP266 documentation
+++++++++++++++++++++++
Welcome to my COMP 266 project. Here you'll find my learning diary, my reading notes, and useful attachments like my sitemap, personas, and prototypes. You'll also find my source code, which you're free to fork and repurpose.

What's in my learning diary?
==============================
The learning diary is a requirement of COMP 266. Essentially, you're to document your reflections as evidence to the self directed course completion being honest to the individual, and not to the credit of AI. 

You can learn about my thoughts, and the design process behind my final product. It's going to be quite unedited, so despite my best efforts, you might find some typos in a verbose sea of self reflection. 

You're free to join me while I talk to myself and pace around my code. Hopefully I don't lose sanity and start to hear voices talk back, but I'd be happy to hear from you on the AU landing. If you're not a student of AU, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or GitHub.


What's in my reading notes?
==============================
If you know me, you know I mark up all my books and notes. I've included an attachments section to contain the .pdf markups for each chapters reading.

You can download these and open them in a .pdf reader to see my comments.

Like my learning diary, these are quite unfiltered. They offer me a way to go back in time to re-read the most important details.


What's the sitemap about?
==============================

Pending unit 1, the sitemap will contain information like the personas, a mood board, the system design, user stories, and general planning of the project. 

I'm undecided what I'll call this section, so keep in mind that this section might get renamed.


What's my project code about?
==============================

Since I'm working through unit 1 shortly, I'll let you know soon.
