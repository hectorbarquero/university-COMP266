COMP266 documentation
+++++++++++++++++++++++
Welcome to my COMP 266 project. Here you'll find my learning diary, my reading notes, and useful attachments like my sitemap, personas, and prototypes. You'll also find my source code, which you're free to fork and repurpose.



What's in my learning diary?
==============================
The learning diary is a requirement of COMP 266. Essentially, you're to document your reflections as evidence to the self directed course completion being honest to the individual, and not to the credit of AI. You can learn about my thoughts, and the design process behind my final product. It's going to be quite un-edited, so despite my best efforts, you might find some typos in a verbose sea of self reflection. 

You're free to join me while I talk to myself and pace around my office and my code. Hopefully I don't lose sanity and start to hear voices talk back, but I'd be happy to hear from you. Connect with me on the AU landing, or on LinkedIn or GitHub.


What's in my reading notes?
==============================
I'm attaching some reading notes with each unit. 


What's the sitemap about?
==============================

What's my project code about?
==============================




I don't check emails often. Connect with me on LinkedIn, or learn more about what I'm up to on my GitHub.
