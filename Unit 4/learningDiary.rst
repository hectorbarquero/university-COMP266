Unit 4 Script use and augmentation

.. _unit4-ref:

.. Warning::
   Nothing to see here. I am currently working Unit 3. Check back soon, since I'm updating these docs as I work on the code. Unit 4 is here staged for the next submission after Unit 3.

Summary
========

   *"Lorem ipsum - currently working"*


The work
==========
.. describe briefly what you have done as work for that unit.

1. Visit `AU course book <https://scis.lms.athabascau.ca/mod/book/view.php?id=13065>`_ > **print book** as .pdf for offline reading.

2. Read the 33 instruction pages.

    .. Note::
       The Unit 4 reading markup is provided as an attachment under **References**.

3. Find a small piece (or pieces) of javascript from the web, and integrate it into one or more of your web pages. **Make sure to cite it**.

4. In your learning diary, describe what it does. Critique it. Describe how it relates to your personas from Unit 1.

5. Upload the docs to GitHub and submit a learning diary post as a blog entry in the **Group Blog**



Assignment 4 submission
========================
.. describe the rationale for what you have done, relating your work explicitly to the personas and scenarios you developed in Unit 1.

Javascript critique:
----------------------




The learning map
=================
.. for each learning outcome for the unit, explain how you have met it, with reference to the content that you produce (typically your code or other design artifacts).

Use this section to map my learning with the expected outcomes. This section is for the assessors who are grading my work.

Expected outcomes for Unit 3
-----------------------------
1. Critique JavaScript code written by others, identifying examples of both good and bad practice.

2. Use JavaScript to add dynamic content to pages.

3. Modify existing JavaScript code to extend and alter its functionality and, where appropriate, to correct errors and cases of poor practice


What went right and wrong
==========================
.. describe what you would do differently if you had to do it again.

If I were to do this unit again, I might go back to Unit 1 and have proposed better mockups that suit javascript snippets. I designed my website holistically and did not know we would be introducing small modules in unit 4, so I feel I struggled a bit to pick something small and simple that was already done on the web. 

Most of my designs and plans seem to be larger and more complex, so this worked against me.
